<p>By the end of this lesson you should be able to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Recall and explain how the <strong>{ggplot2}</strong> package for data visualization is based on a theoretical framework called the <strong>grammar of graphics</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Name and describe the 3 essential components required for building a graph: <strong>data</strong>, <strong>aesthetics</strong>, and <strong>geometries</strong>.</p></li>

<p>These studies are much more complex than what we will do there, but let’s see if we can find any patterns even with basic <strong>exploratory data visualization</strong>.</p>
<p>We can get some information about patterns in this data by inspecting summary statistics given by the <strong><code>summary()</code></strong> function:</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>This gives us values for the maximum, minimum, and quartiles of each numeric variable, and the number of observations (rows) for each region. This is summary useful, but it omits a large amount information contained in the dataset.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that summary statistics can be highly misleading, and a simple plot can reveal a lot more.</p>
<p>The easiest and clearest way to analyze patterns from this dataset is to visualize it!</p>
<p>The best way to do this in R is with {ggplot2}. So let’s see how that works.</p>

<h3 data-number="17.4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-layered-grammar-of-graphics"><span class="header-section-number">17.4.2</span> The layered Grammar of Graphics</h3>
<p>The <code>gg</code> in <code>ggplot</code> is short for “<code>g</code>rammar of <code>g</code>raphics”, which is the data visualization philosophy that {ggplot2} is based on.</p>
<p>The <strong>grammar of graphics</strong> is a theoretical framework which deconstructs the process of producing a graph.</p>
<p>Think of how we construct and form sentences in written and spoken languages by combining different elements, like nouns, verbs, articles, subjects, objects, etc. We can’t just combine these elements in any arbitrary order; we must do so following a set of rules known as a linguistic grammar.</p>
<p>Similarly, the grammar of graphics (GG) defines a set of rules for constructing <em>graphics</em> by combining different types of elements, known as <em>layers</em>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/gglayers.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="392"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">The grammar of graphics framework dissects a graph into individual components, which belong to these seven distinct layers. We take these different layers and combine them together to build a plot.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The three layers at the bottom of this figure - <strong>data</strong>, <strong>aesthetics</strong>, and <strong>geometries</strong> - are required for building any plot.</p>
<p>Let’s define what they mean:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong><code>data</code></strong>: the dataset containing the variables of interest.</p>
<p><img src="images/gglayers_data.png" class="img-fluid" width="450"></p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>aes</code></strong>thetics: things we can see that visually communicate information in our data.</p>
<p><img src="images/gglayers_aes.png" class="img-fluid" width="450"></p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>geom</code></strong>etry: the geometric shape used to represent data in a plot: points, lines, bars, etc.</p>
<p><img src="images/gglayers_geom.png" class="img-fluid" width="450"></p></li>
</ol>
<p>You might be wondering why we wrote <code>data</code>, <code>geom</code>, and <code>aes</code> in a computer code type font. You’ll see very shortly that we use these terms in R code to represent GG layers.</p>

<p>In this section, we will work towards a first plot with {ggplot2}. It will be a scatter plot using data from <code>nigerm</code>.</p>
<p>For easier plotting in this lesson, we will use a smaller subsets of the <code>nigerm</code> data frame at a time.</p>
<p>First let’s create one called <code>nigerm96</code>, which only contains measles case data for the year 1996. Running the code below will create <code>nigerm96</code> and add it to your RStudio Environment:</p>

<p>Time to start building a <code>ggplot</code> in increments! We’ll do this by starting with a blank canvas and then adding one layer at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Step 0: Call the <code>ggplot()</code> function</strong></p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="do">## Call the `ggplot()` function</span></span>

<p><img src="data_on_display_ls01_gg_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As you can see, this gives us nothing but a blank canvas. But not to worry, we’re about to add some more elements.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Provide data</strong></p>
<p>The first input we need to supply the <code>ggplot()</code> function is the data layer (i.e., a data frame), by filling in the <code>data</code> argument (<code>data = DF_NAME</code>):</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="do">## Data layer</span></span>

<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="data_on_display_ls01_gg_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This gives us blank plot again, since we’ve only supplied one out of the three inputs required for a complete graphic. Next we need to assign variables to aesthetic mappings.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Define the variables</strong></p>
<p>What should we plot on our axes? Let’s say we want to make an epidemic time series plot. To do that, we plot time (in weeks) on the x-axis, and disease incidence (number of reported cases) on the y-axis. In <code>ggplot</code>-speak, we are <code>mapping</code> the variable <code>cases</code> to the <code>x</code> aesthetic, and <code>week</code> to the <code>y</code> aesthetic.</p>
<p>Let’s tell <code>ggplot()</code> which variables to to plot on the aesthetics layer with a <code>mapping</code> argument, using this syntax: <code>mapping = aes(x = VAR1, y = VAR2)</code>.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="do">## Aesthetics layer: x and y position</span></span>

<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="data_on_display_ls01_gg_intro_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="672"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There’s still no data plotted, but the axis scales, titles, and labels are present. The x-axis marks weeks of the year from 1 to 52, and the y-axis shows that the number of weekly reported cases per region ranges from 0 to around 2000.</p>
<p>The plot is still lacking the required geometry layer.</p>

<p><code>aes()</code> stands for aesthetics - things we can see. Variables are always inside the <code>aes()</code> function, which in return is inside a <code>ggplot()</code>. Take a moment to observe the double closing brackets <strong><code>))</code></strong> - the first one belongs to <code>aes()</code>, the second one to <code>ggplot()</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Step 3: Specify which type of plot to create</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we add a geometry layer using a <code>geom_*</code> function. This determines which geometric objects - or visual markers - should be used to map the data.</p>
<p>Since we are looking at the relationship of two numerical variables, it makes sense to use a <strong>scatter plot</strong>. The geometric objects used to represent data on scatter plots are <strong>points</strong>, and the <code>geom_*</code> function for scatter plots is conveniently named <strong><code>geom_point()</code></strong>. We’ll add this function as new layer using a <strong><code>+</code></strong> sign:</p>

<p>Points have been added, and this is now a complete scatter plot! There are 8 points per week, representing each of the 8 regions (but at this point we cannot tell which point is from which region).</p>

<p>It’s your turn to practice plotting with <code>ggplot()</code>! For practice exercises in this lesson, you will be using a different subset of <code>nigerm</code> called <strong><code>nigerm04</code></strong>, which contains only data from the year 2004:</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the grammar of graphics allows for a high degree of customization of plots and also a consistent framework for easily updating and modifying them.</p>
<p>We can tinker with our existing code to switch up the data, aesthetics, and geometry inputs supplied to <code>ggplot()</code>, and create variations of the original plot. In fact, you’ve already done this by changing the dataset from <code>nigerm96</code> to <code>nigerm04</code> in the practice question.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <code>aes</code>thetics and <code>geom</code>etry inputs can also be changed to create different visualizations. In the next few sections we will take the scatter plot we built in the previous section, and make incremental changes to modify different elements of the original code.</p>

<p>We created a scatter plot of <code>cases</code> vs <code>week</code> for <code>nigerm96</code> with this code:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>If we copy the same code and change just one thing - by replacing the <code>x</code> variable <code>week</code> (numerical) with <code>region</code> (categorical) - we get what’s called a <strong>strip plot</strong>:</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
</div>
<p>While the y-axis values of the points are the same as before, their x-axis mappings have changed significantly. They are now mapped to 8 separate positions along the x-axis, each corresponding to a discrete category of the <code>region</code> variable.</p>

<p>Similarly, we can modify the geometry layer to create a different type of plot, while still using the same aesthetic mappings.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/geoms.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption class="figure-caption">{ggplot2} has a variety of different <code>geom_*</code> functions and geometric objects which you can use to visualize your data. Here are some examples of different types of geoms that can be used with <code>ggplot()</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Let’s copy and paste the original scatter plot code once again, but this time we will replace the <code>geom_*</code> function instead of the <code>x</code> aesthetic. If we change <code>geom_point()</code> to <strong><code>geom_col()</code></strong>, we get a <strong>bar plot</strong> (sometimes called a <code>col</code>umn chart):</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">ggplot</span>(<span class="at">data =</span> nigerm96, </span>

</div>
</div>
<p>Again, the rest of the code is still the same - we just changed the key word of the <code>geom_*</code> function. However, the plot is significantly different that either the scatter plot or the strip plot.</p>
<p>Notice that the y-axis has been rescaled. The height of each bar represents the cumulative number of weekly cases, i.e, the total number of cases reported from all eight regions that week, rather than showing 8 separate data points for each region.</p>

<p>Not all plot types are interchangeable. Using a <code>geom_*</code> function that is not compatible with the variables you defined in <code>aes()</code> will give you an error. For example, let’s replace <code>geom_point()</code> with <code>geom_histogram()</code> instead:</p>

</div>
<p>This is because a histogram shows the distribution of one numerical variable. <code>ggplot()</code> can’t map two variables to both the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>-axis positions with a histogram, so it throws an error.</p>

<p>To see the full list of aesthetics that can be used with a particular <code>geom_*</code> function look it up the function documentation. You can do this by pressing F1 on a function, e.g., <code>geom_point()</code> to open the Help tab, and scroll down to the “Aesthetics” section. If F1 is hard to summon on your keyboard, type and run <code>?geom_point</code> in your Console tab.</p>

<p>Let’s add color to our scatter plot. We can map the categorical variable <code>region</code> to the <code>color</code> aesthetic. We can do this by modifying the original code to add a new argument inside <code>mapping = aes()</code>. Let’s see what happens when we add <code>color = region</code> inside <code>aes()</code>:</p>

<p>Now we have a colorful scatter plot! Each point is colored according to the region it belongs to. This allows us to better distinguish between regions.</p>
<p>Note that <code>ggplot()</code> automatically provides a color legend on the left.</p>

<p>By examining the color patterns in the plot, you can make out the classic bell-shaped epidemic curves showing a rise and fall in measles incidence in each region.</p>
<p>Zinder had the largest number of cases and the steepest epidemic curve, followed by Maradi and Niamey.</p>
<p>While the colorful plot provides more insight into measles patterns at the regional level than the scatter plot with no color mapping, this graph still looks busy and is not the most intuitive to read. A different plot type could help with this.</p>
<p>Next we will try a bar plot, then a line graph.</p>
<p>Let’s try the same <code>color = region</code> aesthetic mapping with <code>geom_col()</code> instead:</p>

<p>This gives us a stacked bar plot, where the bars are divided into smaller sections. This shows us the proportional contribution of individual regions (i.e., the height or length of each subsection represents how much each region contributes to the total number of cases that week).</p>
<p>The stacked bar plot here is outlined by color. This is because the <code>color</code> aesthetic in {ggplot2} generally refers to the border around a shape. This did not apply to the default shapes in our scatter plot created with <code>geom_point()</code> because they are solid dots (not hollow), but you can see that it does apply to the bars in a bar chart created <code>geom_col()</code>. However, the grey filling is not very pretty.</p>
<p>We might want to color the inside of the bars instead. This is done by mapping our variable to the <code>fill</code> aesthetic. We can copy the code above and simply change <code>color</code> to <code>fill</code> inside <code>aes()</code>:</p>

<p>Voila! The inside of the bars are now filled with colors.</p>
<p>Now practice using the <code>color</code> aesthetic mapping with a new plot type: line graphs. Line graphs are generally considered one of the best plot types for time series data.</p>

<h3 data-number="17.6.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fixed-aesthetics-outside-aes"><span class="header-section-number">17.6.4</span> Fixed aesthetics outside <code>aes()</code></h3>
<p>It is very important to understand the difference between <strong>aesthetic mappings</strong> and <strong>fixed aesthetics</strong>. The main aesthetics in <code>ggplot</code> are: <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>fill</code>, and <code>size</code>, and any of these could be either a mapping or a fixed value. This depends on whether they appear inside or outside the <code>aes()</code> function.</p>
<p>When we apply an aesthetic to modify the geometric objects according to a variable (e.g., the color of points changes according to the region variable), that’s an aesthetic mapping. This must always be defined <strong>inside</strong> <code>mapping = aes()</code>, like we just did in previous examples.</p>
<p>But if you want to apply a visual modification to <em>all</em> the geometric objects evenly (e.g., manually change the color of all points to be one color), that’s a fixed aesthetic. We must set fixed aesthetics to a constant value <strong>outside</strong> <code>mapping = aes()</code> and directly inside the <code>geom_*</code> function - e.g., <code>geom_point(color = "COLOR_NAME")</code>.</p>
<p>Here let’s change the color of all the points in our scatter plot to blue:</p>
